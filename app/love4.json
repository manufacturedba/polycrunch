I hope it's not weird that I message you, but I do have sort of an odd reason for messaging you in the first place. One of my very close friends at Berry College is coming to Colorado this summer to work an unpaid internship with the Geological Society of America in north Denver. He receives a need-based scholarship in return for so many hours of community service throughout the year and during summer breaks. He's trying to find somewhere to live while he's in Denver, and I knew you and Roberto had moved there relatively recently. That's why I'm contacting you guys. Would you have an extra room or even a couch or futon on which you wouldn't mind an undergraduate student crashing for the summer? I'll be frank; he can pay little to no rent because all of his work money goes to paying off his tuition so he can afford to go to school here without taking out student loans. Is this something you guys would consider? Thanks so much for your time. Hope you're both well!\n","2016-04-28 08:34: Maria Venable: Message to me.\n","2016-04-28 09:00: Roberto Rodriguez: WHO?!\n","2016-04-28 09:01: Roberto Rodriguez: piss off m8\n","2016-04-28 09:12: Maria Venable: Sara is taking the person in\n","2016-04-28 09:12: Maria Venable: <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"😮\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f62e.png\"/>\n","2016-04-28 09:12: Maria Venable: no worries.\n","2016-04-28 09:19: Maria Venable: jk Sara said no since it's a guy not a girl\n","2016-04-28 09:21: Roberto Rodriguez: who was asking?\n","2016-04-28 09:21: Roberto Rodriguez: it's weird if it's basically a stranger\n","2016-04-28 09:21: Maria Venable: Courtney, her dad and my dad are bffs\n","2016-04-28 09:22: Roberto Rodriguez: so weird\n","2016-04-28 09:22: Maria Venable: Yeaaaaahhhhh\n","2016-04-28 10:05: Maria Venable: we should order you contacts that match your glasses prescription.\n","2016-04-28 10:05: Roberto Rodriguez: maibe\n","2016-04-28 10:06: Maria Venable: you get up to $130 for free\n","2016-04-28 10:34: Maria Venable: \n<a target='blank' href='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FUZwqhPVJvE/VyJJiK3Ux8I/AAAAAAAAinI/8s0CJF0VWf8P_j3mBbNALH4bKuyMSz1FQCK8B/s0/2016-04-28.png'><img class='thumb' src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FUZwqhPVJvE/VyJJiK3Ux8I/AAAAAAAAinI/8s0CJF0VWf8P_j3mBbNALH4bKuyMSz1FQCK8B/s0/2016-04-28.png' /></a>\n","2016-04-28 10:34: Maria Venable: <img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"😯\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f62f.png\"/><img class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" alt=\"😲\" src=\"https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f632.png\"/>\n","2016-04-28 10:36: Roberto Rodriguez: wat\n","2016-04-28 10:37: Maria Venable: yeah, I got an email from them with that coupon\n","2016-04-28 10:37: Maria Venable: I feel the need to go..\n","2016-04-28 10:45: Maria Venable: can we swing by whole foods on the way home?
